The inventory module should consist of the following fields :

1) Product Number
2) Product Name
3) Product Type [Grocery/Dairy/Cosmetics]
4) Price
5) Quantity
 

 

The access is given to Administrator alone. An Administrator should be able to

Search on Product Number/Product Name
 

The Sales module should consist of

1) Date
2) Product Number
3) Product Name
4) Quantity
5) Price
6) Total Cost
 

This module is accessible by Administrator and Salesperson.

The Administrator should be able to

->Create entries 
->Modify entries
->Delete entries
 

The salesperson should be able to

->Create entries 
->Modify entries
 
At the end of the day:-

->The sum of quantities of a particular product in the sales module should be tallied with the Inventory module and report should be generated on the current stock of products.
->The total cost in the sales module should be tallied with sum of the prices of individual products sold.
